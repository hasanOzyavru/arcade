### How to play

The game runs on a canvas, and the playeris expected to cross across the dangerous zone in steps to reach the safe
target area by use of arrow keys. The dangerous zone is the area where enemies are flowing in from the left at one
of the 3 random locations and movingto the right at a random speed which is upper and lower bounded, keeping their
x-axis position fixed.

If an enemy hits the player, game restarts. 

Success is to make maximum number of moves in dangerous zone and to reach safe area without being hit.

There are 3 levels of difficulty : Standard, Difficult and Easy. The level is determined by user before starting
or restarting the game. Depending on the level of chosen difficulty, enemy production rate is changing. The slowest 
production of enemies means Easy level.
